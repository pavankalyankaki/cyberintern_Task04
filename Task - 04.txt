Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows/Linux
Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic.
Tools

Windows: Windows Firewall
Linux: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

Deliverables
Screenshot/configuration file showing firewall rules applied.

Hints/Mini Guide

Open firewall configuration tool (Windows Firewall or terminal for UFW)
List current firewall rules
Add a rule to block inbound traffic on a specific port (e.g., 23 for Telnet)
Test the rule by attempting to connect to that port locally or remotely
Add rule to allow SSH (port 22) if on Linux
Remove the test block rule to restore original state
Document commands or GUI steps used
Summarize how firewall filters traffic

Outcome
Basic firewall management skills and understanding of network traffic filtering.

Interview Questions & Answers
1. What is a firewall?
A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (like the internet), filtering traffic to prevent unauthorized access and cyber threats.
2. Difference between stateful and stateless firewall?

Stateful Firewall: Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of traffic flow. It remembers previous packets and connection states, providing better security by understanding the full conversation context.
Stateless Firewall: Examines each packet independently without considering the connection state or previous packets. It makes filtering decisions based solely on packet headers (source/destination IP, ports, protocols).

3. What are inbound and outbound rules?

Inbound Rules: Control traffic coming into your network or system from external sources. They determine what external connections are allowed to reach your services.
Outbound Rules: Control traffic leaving your network or system to external destinations. They determine what internal systems can connect to external services.

4. How does UFW simplify firewall management?
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) simplifies firewall management by:

Providing simple, human-readable commands instead of complex iptables syntax
Using intuitive commands like ufw allow 22 instead of lengthy iptables rules
Offering easy enable/disable functionality
Providing clear status displays and rule listings
Reducing configuration errors through simplified syntax

5. Why block port 23 (Telnet)?
Port 23 (Telnet) should be blocked because:

Unencrypted communication: All data, including passwords, is transmitted in plain text
Security vulnerability: Susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks
Legacy protocol: Modern secure alternatives like SSH (port 22) provide encrypted communication
Compliance requirements: Many security standards require disabling insecure protocols

6. What are common firewall mistakes?

Default deny policy not implemented: Allowing all traffic by default instead of denying
Overly permissive rules: Opening too many ports or allowing broad IP ranges
Not documenting rules: Making it difficult to maintain and audit
Ignoring outbound traffic: Focusing only on inbound rules while neglecting outbound filtering
Not regular updates: Failing to review and update rules as network requirements change
Weak logging: Not enabling proper logging for monitoring and incident response

7. How does a firewall improve network security?
Firewalls improve network security by:

Access control: Blocking unauthorized access attempts and malicious traffic
Traffic filtering: Inspecting packets and blocking suspicious or unwanted communications
Network segmentation: Creating security zones and controlling inter-zone communication
Threat prevention: Stopping known attack patterns and malicious IP addresses
Monitoring capabilities: Providing logs and alerts for security analysis
Compliance support: Helping meet regulatory requirements for network security

8. What is NAT in firewalls?
NAT (Network Address Translation) in firewalls is a technique that:

Translates IP addresses: Converts private internal IP addresses to public IP addresses for internet communication
Hides internal structure: Conceals internal network topology from external networks
Enables address reuse: Allows multiple internal devices to share a single public IP address
Provides security layer: Acts as an implicit firewall by preventing direct external access to internal devices
Port mapping: Can redirect specific ports from public IP to internal services
